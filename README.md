# Single-Path-One-Shot-NAS
SPOS(Single Path One-Shot Neural Architecture Search with Uniform Sampling(https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00420)) rebuilt in Pytorch with single GPU.          
However, it's very time consuming to train this Network on ImageNet and I haven't got the final result yet.I will update the repo soon.     
I'd appreciate it if you find some bugs in this code or get the final result because I won't have so much time to check this for the starting of school. Please contact me at 470651748@qq.com.
