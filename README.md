# Single-Path-One-Shot-NAS
This repo provides a Pytorch-based implementation of SPOS([Single Path One-Shot Neural Architecture Search with Uniform Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00420))  by Zichao Guo, and et. al.
![SPOS](https://github.com/ShunLu91/Single-Path-One-Shot-NAS/blob/master/img/SPOS.jpg)
However, this repo only contains 'Block Search' and it's very time consuming to train this network on ImageNet so I haven't got the final result yet. I will update the repo soon and greatly thanks to Zichao Guo for his advice on some details.      
Yet, there are still some differences with the [official version](https://github.com/megvii-model/ShuffleNet-Series/tree/master/OneShot) such as data preprocessing and some hyper parameters.        
                
## Problem
With the help of @NiuRc, I am really sorry to inform you that the loss of this code is not going to decrease(both on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet) and we are trying to find the problem. Nevertheless, I'd appreciate it if you find the problem in this repo or get the final result. Welcome to pull requests here. Thanks a lotÔºÅ

## Environments    
```
Python == 3.6.8, Pytorch == 1.1.0, CUDA == 9.0.176, cuDNN == 7.3.0, GPU == Single GTX 1080Ti 
```

## Dataset   
SPOS directly can train on ImageNet.ImageNet needs to be manually downloaded and [here](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/imagenet) are some instructions.   
         
## Usage
```
python train.py --train_dir YOUR_TRAINDATASET_PATH --val_dir YOUR_VALDATASET_PATH
```

## To Do
- [x] Block Search
- [ ] Channel Search
- [ ] Evolutionary Algorithm
