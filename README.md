# Single-Path-One-Shot-NAS
SPOS([Single Path One-Shot Neural Architecture Search with Uniform Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00420)) rebuilt in Pytorch with single GPU.          
This code only contains 'Block Search'.However, it's very time consuming to train this Network on ImageNet and I haven't got the final result yet.I will update the repo soon.      
I'd appreciate it if you find some bugs in this code or get the final result because I won't have so much time to check this for the starting of school. Please contact me at 470651748@qq.com.

## Environments:    
```Python
Python == 3.6.8, Pytorch == 1.1.0, CUDA == 9.0.176, cuDNN == 7.3.0, GPU == GTX 1080 Ti 
```

## Dataset:
